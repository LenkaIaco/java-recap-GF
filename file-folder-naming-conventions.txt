1. java class file / test class: pascal naming conv.(camelCase):
	 	CustomerService.java / CustomerServiceTest.java
2. other files: lowercase, hyphen/underscore instead of space 
		project-overview.md

3. Folders which are java packages! 
Follow the same naming restriction as field variables: 
	lowercase,hyphens or all lowercase words glued together: 
		user_data/userdata/*

	The reason is that e.g. dashes are considered an operator(minus) so they are unusable in variable names, or class names, or package names:

	int myvar;
	java.lang.String myvar;
	package.subpackage.MyClass myvar; 

	All of these - classes, field names and packages(within the fully qualified classname context) are absolutely coming up in a java class code. If we use dash or any other sign that 	has an assigned meaning in code(like - minus operation), the code would not compile.

	Java package names may only contain letters, digits, underscores, and $


	Java package names follows reverse domain name parts in corporate environments:
		com.example.app	

	
4.other folders: 
	dash - and hyphen — are the norm in separating words within a folder name:
	my-folder/out

Standard folder/file naming practices(outside java):
Stick to:
a–z, 0–9, -, _, .

Avoid:
! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) { } [ ] ; : ' " < > ? | \ /
